# Pomodoro Application

## Overview
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique helps improve focus and productivity by encouraging sustained concentration and regular rest.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: Contains the basic structure of the Pomodoro web application.
- **style.css**: Intended for styling the application, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **script.js**: Meant for implementing the JavaScript functionality, including timer logic and user interactions.

## Usage Instructions
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the Pomodoro application.
2. Set your desired work and break intervals.
3. Start the timer and focus on your tasks.
4. Take breaks as indicated by the timer to maintain productivity.
